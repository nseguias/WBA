Sui Move Q1 Cohort Prerequistes:

1. Read these documents

   a. https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts
   b. https://docs.sui.io/concepts/object-model

2. Set Up and Install Sui
   https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install#install-sui-binaries

3. Create a folder in a GitHub repository and name it `your.name.Q1.Sui.PreR``

4. Put all the following in the folder.

5. Go to Sui By Example - create a new package with: `sui move new prereqs``

In the package, complete the Sui Move examples found in the Sui By Example
resource, but you will want to adjust function, object, variables names to reflect a more
“real” use case that’s interesting to you. We recommend you hand slug these examples
to build muscle memory.

2.1. Move.toml
2.3. Entry Functions
2.5. Shared Object
2.6. Transfer
2.7. Custom transfer
2.8. Events
2.9. One Time Witness
2.11. Object Display
3.1. Capability

6. Fork the Sui Framework to the same folder.

7. Push all of the above to GitHub, and tag `@japarjam` in the comments of the repo - this
   will alert me that you have completed the task.

If you have any questions- ask in the Discord!! The Sui Channel.
